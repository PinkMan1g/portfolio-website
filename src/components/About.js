          I&apos;ve been developing Minecraft content for over five years now. In that time, I&apos;ve worked with multiple teams and studios, creating a wide range of add-ons and dynamic worlds for the Marketplace. I really enjoy bringing ideas to life through scripting and custom gameplay mechanics.  <br /><br />I have solid experience with entities, block components, and building custom mechanics. I also work a lot with particles and custom sounds to obtain better user experience. My goal is always to keep things clean, functional and to deliver on time.  <br /><br /> I regularly use GitHub, Notion and Jira to manage projects and maintain clear workflows.
